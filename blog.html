                        <p class="card-desc">
                            Coding nature isn't just about equations; it's about capturing the chaos. How using
                            PhysiCell and NetLogo taught me that biology is the ultimate "spaghetti code" ... and how to
                            debug it.

                            From the pool lane to the flute section, discipline is muscle memory. Exploring how my 12
                            years of competitive swimming and music shape the resilience I need for 120-hour lab
                            simulations.
