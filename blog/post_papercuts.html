<h1>Paper Cuts and Micro Wars: The Deadly Politics of a Tiny Wound</h1>

<p>Picture this: you grab a piece of paper, ready to write to your heart’s content. But as you begin, you start bleeding
    over the paper. You have a paper cut.</p>

<p>For us, the process is tedious and straightforward: sigh, grab that bandage from the drawer, slap it on, and go back
    to the usual.</p>

<p>However, it’s anything BUT simple for the microbiome within your skin. It’s a bloodthirsty, savage, wrecking
    battlefield of microbacteria fighting for their place at the top of the hill. It’s just like survival of the
    fittest: bacteria style.</p>

<p>A break in one’s skin invites pathogenic bacteria. One of the most common invaders is Staphylococcus aureus. It’s a
    close relative of the harmless S. epidermis, but is well known for its ability to cause serious infections. After it
    enters the wound, immediate conflict begins. Additionally, these individual bacteria invaders are able to team up
    and build their ultimate formation — a biofilm.</p>

<p>A biofilm is a bacterial matrix composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The EPS is a combination of
    polysaccharides (sugars), proteins, lipids, and the bacteria’s eDNA (extracellular DNA) (Otto, 2018). The S. aureus
    cells are then able to secrete these materials and create a 3D scab based structure that can then encase and protect
    the entire bacterial community. Studies that use scanning electron microscopes actually reveal these mini structures
    forming within hours of the infection. (Thurlow et al., 2011)</p>

<p>The biological fortress itself has several advantages for the invading bacteria. It first acts as a physical barrier
    that prevents larger immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages from reaching and engulfing the bacteria (Thurlow
    et al., 2011). The dense matrix also slows down the breakdown from antibiotics. A study that was published in the
    journal of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy demonstrated that bacteria that are in biofilms can actually be up
    to 1000 times more resistant to antibiotics compared to free floating (planktonic) counterparts (Stewart &
    Costerton, 2001). Last, the biofilm environment alters the metabolism of the bacteria within. Basically, it allows
    them to be less detected by drugs that target its growth. Score!</p>

<p>Within this bacterial biofilm, S aureus bacteria are able to continuously multiply while releasing harmful toxins and
    enzymes. The substances damage the surrounding host tissues and lead to inflammation, which is the body’s attempt to
    fight off the threat. However, the immune system can’t effectively reach the bacteria in the biofilm and the
    inflammatory response works against itself (Thurlow et al., 2011).</p>

<p>The persistent inflammation makes it so that rather than clearing the infection and promoting healing, there’s more
    damage to cells and tissues, hindering the wound process. In addition, other growth factors and signals within
    molecules for repair become disrupted and the wound becomes stuck in this state of panic with no escape.</p>

<p>Long story short….that minor cut could lead to very serious complications.</p>

<p>Currently, scientists are exploring innovative strategies to effectively kill and disrupt biofilms. For example,
    bacteriophages are viruses that can specifically target and kill bacteria. Research in this field is aiming to
    potentially engineer phages that can effectively disrupt those biofilms. In addition, enzymes can break down the EPS
    matrix and are currently being seen as a way to deconstruct the biofilm, allowing for antimicrobial agents to reach
    the bacteria.</p>

<p>So, the next time you dismiss a minor cut with a ‘Seriously?’ Just remember that beneath that surface is a brutal
    battle. That small breach can create this war that rages on, potentially creating life threatening implications.
    Understanding strategies and continuing research is critical to the quest for effective healing.</p>
