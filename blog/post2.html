                Why I fell in love with computational biology. It's the "spaghetti code" of life—messy, redundant, and
                beautiful.
            </p>

            <p>
                We often talk about biology as a "hard science," defined by rigid taxonomies. But when I started trying
                to simulate it using code—first with NetLogo and then with PhysiCell—I realized that biology is actually
                closer to "spaghetti code." It is messy, redundant, and beautifully chaotic.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The "Bug" in the System</strong><br>
                During my research stability testing, I spent weeks debugging a specific behavior: my simulated bacteria
                were supposed to secrete an enzyme when pH dropped. In my code, it was a simple `if` statement. But in
                the simulation, they would sometimes trigger too early due to local diffusion gradients I hadn't
                accounted for.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized I wasn't just coding a program; I was coding an <em>agent</em>. An autonomous entity that had
                to "sense" its world. The bug wasn't in the syntax; it was in my oversimplification of nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modeling forces us to define our assumptions. You can't hand-wave a mechanism in C++. You have to define
                the rate, the threshold, the decay. It demands a level of precision that makes the eventual transition
                to the wet lab much more rigorous. To me, this is the art form of the 21st century.
