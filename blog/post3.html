            <p class="journal-excerpt">
                The personal experience that drove me toward diabetic wound healing research. Witnessing the gaps in
                standard care and the "maybes" that families face.
            </p>

            <p>
                It started with a family vacation that wasn't a vacation. My grandfather had been admitted to the
                hospital with potential complications from his long-term diabetes. I remember the heat, the sterile
                smell of the hospital waiting room, and the frustration of uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were met with a lot of "maybes." Maybe the infection would clear. Maybe the antibiotics would work
                this time. Maybe surgery was the only option. Those "maybes" frightened my family and made me angry. I
                couldn't understand why, with all our medical advancements, the solution for a diabetic foot ulcer was
                so static and ineffective.
            </p>
            <p>
                That anger turned into curiosity. I learned that standard antibiotics often fail because they can't
                penetrate the biofilm, a protective shield bacteria build around themselves. It wasn't that the medicine
                was "bad"; it was just the wrong tool for the job. We were trying to use a hammer when we needed a
                lockpick.
            </p>
            <p>
                This realization sparked my interest in <strong>Synthetic Biology</strong>. Instead of just discovering
                new chemicals, what if we could engineer living systems that could sense the infection and deliver the
                treatment exactly where it was needed? That question became the foundation of my high school research
                career.
