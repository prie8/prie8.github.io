            <h1>The Human Side of Medicine</h1>

            <p>
                Over the past year, I’ve had the opportunity to volunteer at a hospital and be a pillar of support for
                numerous patients and visitors. But there is one experience and moment throughout that has forever
                marked me. One day during the regular shift, after coming back from taking a visitor to visit their
                family, I came back to my manager on a phone call with a stern face. As she ended the call and looked at
                me with a sorrowful face. She asked me if I would be comfortable helping this woman whose husband had
                just passed while waiting for family to arrive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I was relatively new to this, I took up the opportunity because personally I’ve seen how hard
                it is for a loved one to pass while your family isn’t there. It happened to my great-grandfather, while
                his wife passed, my dad flew to India to go and support him and fellow family members, and that
                definitely made a lasting impact for him. Similarly, I wanted to make a lasting impact for the recent
                widow.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went up to the room and saw her very emotionally, offering her tissues and just to be a listening ear.
                She explained to me how she didn’t really know much of what to do, as her husband just died, she was
                relatively new to everything. Her husband had originally been hospitalized from a heart attack but was
                presumed to also be impacted from a likely cause of cancer. The cause made her worry more, if he ever
                had a chance outside of the heart attack, and how long he would’ve even been alive. She talked about how
                she wished she had those extra days and that the heart attack didn’t beat cancer to death of him,
                although him having cancer was worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                She said in a way, maybe it was better for him to go now rather than to have to go through all that
                pain. But for me it made me wonder, what if cancer was the true silent killer that propelled that heart
                attack because that was definitely a possibility. The widow continued to cry and I continued to be next
                to her, listening to her stories and reminiscing of his past. Knowing her life was changed forever in
                that moment, created the same for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                From this moment, my life was forever changed. This made me realize that this is the story and the
                emotional rollercoaster of millions and millions of families all over the world, losing their closest
                and most beloved loved ones to cancer. It helped me realize a passion for support within healthcare, but
                it made me more intrigued and driven to want to do something, to discover something and truly fight the
                beast of cancer from its origin. Tied in with my passionate learning at school with genetic material of
                DNA and RNA, I hope that potentially understanding the impact and combination of these two at its core
                can truly make a difference.
