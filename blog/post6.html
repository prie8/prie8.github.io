                Overcoming the "imposter syndrome" and the noise of external expectations. Why keeping your own
                scorecard is the most important metric.
            </p>

            <p>
                Starting high-level research as a high schooler feels a bit like walking into a room where everyone
                speaks a language you're just learning. You feel the pressure to prove you belong, to show that you can
                handle the "real science."
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember receiving a rejection early on where I was told to focus on "girl things." It was a jarring
                reminder that stereotypes still exist. It stung (right behind the sternum, as I like to say), but it
                also clarified my purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized that my identity as a young woman in STEM isn't a hurdle; it's a perspective. I bring a
                different set of questions to the table. I bring the resilience of my grandmother and aunt, who faced
                their own systemic barriers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Navigating this identity means building a "Community of Peers," finding others who share that drive to
                "nerd out" on science regardless of background. It means understanding that failure is data, not a
                definition of worth. I'm building my confidence one experiment, one line of code, and one blog post at a
                time.
            </p>
