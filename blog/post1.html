                Reflections on my time as a hospital ambassador. Healthcare isn't just about clinical outcomes; it's
                about the empathy required to sit with uncertainty.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a hospital ambassador at MultiCare Good Samaritan, I spent over 150 hours sitting at the front desk,
                welcoming visitors. But the most impactful moments weren't the logistics; they were the interactions
                with families waiting for news.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned that medicine is often a language of "wait and see." For families, that waiting period is
                excruciating. My role wasn't to treat the patient, but to treat the anxiety of the loved ones. Simple
                acts of communication—updating them on delays, offering a chair, or just listening—could transform their
                experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience profoundly influenced my research. When I work on diabetic wound healing, I don't just
                see a "biological problem" to solve with code. I see the patients I met who were dealing with chronic
                pain and the fear of amputation. It reminds me that every data point in my simulation represents a human
                life waiting for a better answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                True medicine requires a dual competency: the technical skill to cure the disease, and the emotional
                intelligence to care for the person.
