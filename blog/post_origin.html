            <p>
                Good morning, everyone. My project, "Personalized Diabetic Wound Healing: A CRISPR Based Synthetic
                Biology Approach Using Engineered Probiotics," isn't just a scientific endeavor for me; it's deeply
                personal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up here in America, some of my most cherished memories are the visits from my grandparents from
                India. But alongside the joy, I also witnessed something that profoundly affected me: their daily
                struggle with diabetes. I saw firsthand how this disease impacted their lives, especially my
                grandfather. Simple things became difficult, and their quality of life was often diminished. One of the
                most challenging aspects for him, and for us as a family watching, was the development of diabetic foot
                ulcers – wounds that just wouldn't heal, constantly at risk of infection, and causing persistent pain.
                It was heartbreaking to see them suffer, knowing that millions worldwide face this same debilitating
                complication.
            </p>
            <p>
                That experience, watching the people I love grapple with the severe consequences of diabetes, became a
                driving force behind my research. I wanted to find a better way, a smarter way, to help.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem with diabetic wounds is often the stubborn microbial biofilms that form, shielding harmful
                bacteria from antibiotics and preventing healing. My project proposes a novel solution: an engineered
                probiotic system, a kind of 'living medicine,' designed to intelligently combat these biofilms.
            </p>
            <p>
                This research is more than just code and simulations for me. It's a way to channel my love for my
                grandparents and my desire to alleviate the suffering I witnessed into tangible scientific action. It's
                about harnessing cutting-edge tools like CRISPR not just for academic exploration, but to create
                solutions that could one day improve the quality of life for people like them.
