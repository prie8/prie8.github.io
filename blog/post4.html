            <p class="journal-excerpt">
                Leading public health initiatives has taught me that science is a telephone. It requires two-way
                communication to be effective.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the past two years, I have worked with an organization in Bauchi, Nigeria, to assemble workshops
                and infographics regarding early school dropouts and health education. Leading a team of four interns,
                we successfully fundraised over $1,500 for a Hepatitis awareness campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the most significant lesson wasn't about the money; it was about the messaging. Initially, our
                campaign struggled to gain traction. We realized we were broadcasting "at" the community rather than
                speaking "with" them. We had to pivot our strategy to be more perceptive to niche audiences and local
                cultural contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I saw a similar dynamic closer to home when organizing a bone marrow registry drive. We found that
                location mattered immensely. By moving our event to a local Ganesha festival, we were able to engage
                with the South Asian community directly, a demographic that is critically underrepresented in the
                registry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether in Nigeria or my local park, the lesson remains: <strong>Messages are vital for change.</strong>
                Scientific innovation means nothing if it cannot be communicated to and accepted by the people it aims
                to serve.
            </p>
