                Connecting the rigor of competitive swimming to the scientific process. How staring at the black line in
                the pool taught me to push through failure.
            </p>

            <p>
                I often compare research to my experience as a competitive swimmer. In swimming, you spend hours staring
                at a black line on the bottom of the pool. You practice the same stroke, the same turn, thousands of
                times. Most days, you don't get a "personal best." You just get tired.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research is similar. 90% of it is the "black line"—running the simulation again, debugging the code,
                pipetting the solution. It's repetitive and often filled with micro-failures.
            </p>
            <p>
                My flute practice taught me the same lesson. "Expel air too fast, repel a note far too high." It demands
                a precision that only comes from discipline. You can't rush mastery.
            </p>
            <p>
                This discipline was crucial when I faced rejection from a professor early in my research journey. The
                feedback was harsh, but because I was used to the "grind" of practice, I didn't see it as a stop sign. I
                saw it as a coaching critique. I went back to the "pool"—my code—and refined my technique until it
                worked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discipline isn't about motivation; it's about consistency in the face of boredom and failure.
