            <h1>Navigating Identity</h1>

            <p>
                As a first generation Indian American, my upbringing was shaped by my grandparents in India, who were
                primarily farmers. Immigrating to America was a very different environment for both my parents and
                myself. Growing up as an Indian girl in Olympia, particularly during my elementary and middle school
                years, had significant challenges. Foremost, I was among the few Indian girls in my school. I felt
                isolated and confused regarding who I even was because I never knew what side of me I fit into. There
                was the cultural part of me that was never let out and I got pushed back and forth between personalities
                I made.
            </p>
            <p>
                I frequently encountered confusion from others regarding who I was as well. Being mistaken for Native
                American or being questioned about even being American, despite being born in the United States. Within
                the context of my family, there were specific gender roles already. Many women in my family had not gone
                through further education after high school and based on my family’s living situation was not a
                priority. Growing up meant a whole different story from that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although after moving here to Bellevue because of my parent’s job, now it’s almost as if I’m too
                ‘American’ to be a part of the Indian community and classmates I have here. Almost as if I have no real
                part in any community. Ultimately, I felt as if I was invisible or alone at times. But a part of me
                would light up whenever it was regarding one thing. From a young age I used to participate in numerous
                science fairs, and each year partaking in the science fair would be a situation where I could see and
                meet a bunch of different people and their projects. It was basically the most exciting part of my year.
