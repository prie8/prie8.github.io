            <p class="intro-text">
                I don't just want to discover biological truths; I want to <em>build</em> with them.
                To me, bioengineering is where biology stops being just about observation and starts being about
                construction.
                I am fascinated by how engineered living systems can "hack" natural
                processes, like shRNA mimics bypassing nuclear detection, and how we can treat biological molecules as
                machine components.

                <h2>Engineering Stability in Living Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    Within synthetic biology, I am focused on the problem of <strong>mutational drift</strong> in
                    engineered genetic circuits.

                    <h3>Core Question</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>How can we design and engineer genetic circuits that are stable under heavy metabolic stress
                            and remain functional for several generations without positive selection?</em>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This interests me because it's a perfect example of the "Hydra" problem in biology: bacteria evolve
                    to break
                    our designs. In my own work on diabetic wound healing, I ran into this wall when my engineered
                    function would degrade within days. I want to figure out how we can design circuits that constitute
                    robust "living medicines" that can survive this evolutionary pressure.

                    <h3>Signal Fidelity</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>How can we engineer mechanisms within the cell to effectively distinguish between false
                            positives and legitimate environmental signals?</em>

                        Precision is critical in pathology. My "Smart Bacteria" project utilized a pH threshold, but
                        bodily mechanics are complex. I want to develop more sophisticated logic gates (AND/OR/NOT) that
                        can filter noise from true pathological signals.

                <h2>Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs)</h2>
                <p>
                    My current fascination is the "dark matter" of biology: the structures we can't capture with
                    crystallography. I'm intrigued by the 90% of the proteome that is hidden, specifically
                    <strong>Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs)</strong> that lack a fixed 3D
                    structure but still perform complex signaling functions.

                    <h3>Fuzzy Complexes</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>How do IDPs utilize specific "fuzzy complexes" to act as signaling regions that bind to
                            multiple molecules with high specificity, despite low affinity?</em>

                    <h3>Therapeutic Strategy</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>Is it possible to identify cryptic transient pockets within proteins to design small
                            molecules that stabilize their functional state rather than inhibit it?</em>

                        This challenges the standard inhibition model of drug development. If we could nudge a
                        disordered
                        protein back into a healthy state, it could completely change how we treat neurodegenerative
                        diseases.

                    Glucose) to secrete DNase I and IL-10.
