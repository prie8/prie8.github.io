            <h1>Research Interests</h1>
            <p class="intro-text">
                My work is driven by a desire to not just discover biological truths, but to <em>build</em> new
                potential.
                Bioengineering is where biology transcends observation and becomes an avenue for construction.
                I am particularly fascinated by the ability of engineered living systems to "hack" natural
                processes—like shRNA mimics bypassing nuclear detection—and how we can treat biological molecules as
                machine components.

                <h2>Engineering Stability in Living Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    Within synthetic biology, I am focused on the problem of <strong>mutational drift</strong> in
                    engineered genetic circuits.

                    <h3>Core Question</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>How can we design and engineer genetic circuits that are stable under heavy metabolic stress
                            and remain functional for several generations without positive selection?</em>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This interests me because it exemplifies the "Hydra" problem in biology: bacteria evolve to break
                    our designs. In my own work on diabetic wound healing, I faced this limitation where the engineered
                    function could degrade within days. I am interested in exploring how we can design circuits that are
                    robust against this evolutionary pressure, ensuring long-term efficacy for "living medicines."

                    <h3>Signal Fidelity</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>How can we engineer mechanisms within the cell to effectively distinguish between false
                            positives and legitimate environmental signals?</em>

                        Precision is critical in pathology. My "Smart Bacteria" project utilized a pH threshold, but
                        bodily mechanics are complex. I want to develop more sophisticated logic gates (AND/OR/NOT) that
                        can filter noise from true pathological signals.

                <h2>Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs)</h2>
                <p>
                    Molecular and cellular biology often focus on "structure equals function." However, I am captivated
                    by the 90% of the proteome that is hidden—specifically <strong>Intrinsically Disordered
                        Proteins</strong> that lack a fixed 3D structure yet perform complex signaling functions.

                    <h3>Fuzzy Complexes</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>How do IDPs utilize specific "fuzzy complexes" to act as signaling regions that bind to
                            multiple molecules with high specificity, despite low affinity?</em>

                    <h3>Therapeutic Strategy</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em>Is it possible to identify cryptic transient pockets within proteins to design small
                            molecules that stabilize their functional state rather than inhibit it?</em>

                        This challenges the standard inhibition model of drug development. Transitioning a disordered
                        protein into a healthy state could be a transformative approach for neurodegenerative diseases.

                    Glucose) to secrete DNase I and IL-10.
                    Utilized <strong>Benchling</strong> for plasmid design, <strong>PhysiCell (C++)</strong> for
                    agent-based modeling of biofilm reduction, and <strong>NetLogo</strong> for safety switch
                    simulations.
